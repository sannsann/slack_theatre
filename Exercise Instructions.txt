The next step in the application process will be for you to perform a technical exercise. This exercise is meant to demonstrate:

The ability to access a public API and successfully retrieve data from it;
The ability to display that data on a page;
The ability to update the UI of a page without refreshing; and
The ability to do all of the above using only native JavaScript (no libraries such as jQuery).

I'd like you to create a web page that shows a grid of photo thumbnails; when a thumbnail is clicked, the photo should be displayed in a lightbox view, with the ability to move to the next / previous photos and display the photo title. You can use any public API that returns photos; here are some ideas:


This exercise is very important in assessing your technical fit, so make sure you're happy with the result and that it reflects your skills. It should run without errors in the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox and IE.

When you’re done, please send us:

A URL where the working lightbox can be seen
Your source code as a zipped Git repository (create a local repo for your code and commit your files as you normally would; when the exercise is complete, zip your main directory, including the .git directory, and send it to us).
If you have any notes or instructions about the exercise, please include them in a README.md file in your repo.
If you have any notes or instructions about the exercise, please include them in a README.md file in your repo.
